Zzish JS Sample
======================

A simple Example app to allow you to test out the different calls that the Zzish SDK provides.

Try it out via GitHub pages: [Zzish Demo Javascript App](http://zzishdev.github.io/zzishsdk-js)

You will need to generate an applicaiton id by siging up at the [Zzish Developer](http://www.zzish.co.uk/developer) website. 

You will also need to create a class on the [Zzish Learning Hub](http://www.zzish.co.uk/learning-hub) website. After entering the class code (when creating an activity), you will be able to view realtime data on the live dashboard.

Feedback of all shapes and sizes welcome via issues or (email)[mailto:developers@zzish.com].

Thanks for your interest
